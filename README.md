# Retail-Demand-Forecasting

In this project, the task is to predict department-wide sales for 45 stores, located in different regions, using historical sales data. The objective of this project is to develop an accurate predictive model for forecasting retail sales. With access to three key datasets, namely the Stores dataset, Sales Prediction dataset, and Features dataset, we aim to leverage historical sales data and additional relevant features to predict future department-wide sales accurately. This project presents an exciting opportunity to tackle the challenge of sales prediction in the dynamic retail industry.

## Motivation

This project is created to harness the power of predictive analytics to accurately forecast department-wide sales for different stores. By leveraging historical sales data and advanced modeling techniques, retail company can optimize resource allocation, improve demand planning, enhance sales forecasting, refine pricing strategies, drive data-driven decision making, and gain a competitive edge in the retail industry.

Instructions
Here are the project steps for instructions that students can follow for the Retail Sales Prediction project:

1. Understand the Problem and Data
Familiarize yourself with the objective of the project, which is to predict retail sales at different stores.
Explore and understand the provided datasets: Stores, Sales Prediction, and Features.
Analyze the data schema, available columns, and their respective meanings.
Identify any missing values, outliers, or data quality issues that need to be addressed, if necessary, 
 
2. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
Perform necessary data cleaning steps, such as handling missing values, outliers, and duplicates.
Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data, identify patterns, and discover relationships.
Engineer additional features that can potentially enhance the predictive power of the model, such as date-based features, lag features, or aggregated statistics.
Merge the Sales Prediction dataset with the Stores dataset using the common store ID as the key.
Merge the Features dataset with the merged Sales dataset based on shared columns, such as store ID and date.
 

3. Model Selection and Training
Select suitable machine learning algorithms for the sales prediction task, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting.
Split the data into training and validation sets.
Train the selected models on the training data and evaluate their performance using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE) or root mean squared error (RMSE). 


4. Model Evaluation and Fine-tuning
Assess the performance of the trained models using the validation data.
Compare the performance of different models and select the best-performing one.
Fine-tune the selected model by adjusting hyperparameters to optimize its predictive capabilities.
 

5. Predict Sales and Generate Insights
Apply the chosen model to the test dataset to predict retail sales for the desired period.
Evaluate the predictions using evaluation metrics and compare them against the ground truth data if available.
Generate actionable insights from the predictions, such as identifying high-performing stores, analyzing seasonal trends, or detecting sales anomalies.
 

6. Add New Features and Apply Feature Selection
Add holidays to the Sales Prediction
Add consumer price index, unemployment, and holidays to Features datasets
Perform feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant features for the sales prediction.
Consider methods like correlation analysis, feature importance from machine learning models, or domain knowledge-based selection.
 

7. Revisit Modeling Part
Re-run the machine learning models you used before and compare the performance that you get from new dataset with that from the old dataset.
Interpret the result
 

 

8. Documentation and Reporting
Prepare a detailed report documenting the entire project, including the problem statement, data preprocessing steps, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation results.
Clearly present the findings, insights, and recommendations based on the sales predictions.
Include visualizations, code snippets, and explanations to make the report comprehensive and easily understandable.
 

9. Presentation and Communication
Prepare a presentation summarizing the project and its key findings.
Clearly explain the methodology, challenges faced, and lessons learned during the project.
Highlight the significance of accurate retail sales prediction and the potential business implications for retail business.
